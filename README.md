1. SinglepageCV: The goal of this project is to teach you how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. You will focus on laying out your education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner. If you want to use, just copy the code and paste in to the your desired code editor. I prefered Visual Studio Code.
